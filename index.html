        <h2>Education is important</h2>

        <p>In a small village near Masaka in Uganda, a Cristian couple has taken upon themselves to care for children in need. 
       There is a church and a school, both in need of renovation, so teaching takes place outside, at the moment.
       More than 500 children, between 4 and 14 years of age, attend school here in 2022.
       Their strong faith keeps everyday joyful, despite difficulties. We can see that education is important for their future, 
       so this is the main focus. 
       If we view life as a gift and trust that God will provide, many thing are possible; because life has great value!
